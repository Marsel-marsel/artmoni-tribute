# History
When I was a kid I used to play computer games a lot and a program called [artmoney](http://www.artmoney.ru/) was very helpful.
It could make Tommy Vercetti rich right from the start of the game.
The artmoney was pure magic for me, but now I better understand how computer works and I am able to reproduce this magic. 
It simply looking for the desired memory region which stores some quantity and resets its value.
